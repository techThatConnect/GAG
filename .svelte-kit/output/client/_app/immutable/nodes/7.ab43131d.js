Tease is Halifax&#39;s dashing diabetic diva, and her blood sugar is probably higher than yours. Diana aims to bring drag to unconventional places, and in 2022 she raised $1500 for Easter Seals NS by rappelling down a building in drag. They enjoy sewing, playing video games, and tucking her cat Penny into cozy blankets.
      Diana is a queer activist, founder of Halifax Queer Solidarity Project, co-host of the Gay Expectations podcast, and co-founder of Glitter &amp; Grit Events.</p> <div class="flex"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/diana.b.tease/"><img class="icon svelte-bc69m9" src="/src/images/instagram.png" alt=""/></a> <a class="ml-4 p-2 bg-light_pink dark:bg-purp" href="https://www.wheresmyinsulin.gay">wheresmyinsulin.gay</a></div></div>`,c,n,r;return n=new H({}),{c(){a=d("body"),l=d("br"),o=m(),s=d("div"),s.innerHTML=p,c=m(),k(n.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(t){a=g(t,"BODY",{class:!0});var e=x(a);l=g(e,"BR",{}),o=h(e),s=g(e,"DIV",{class:!0,["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),$(s)!=="svelte-b7sk9g"&&(s.innerHTML=p),c=h(e),D(n.$$.fragment,e),e.forEach(u),this.h()},h(){f(s,"class","card bg-gradient-to-t from-light_pink to-light dark:from-purp border-4 border-black rounded-3xl grid grid-rows-2 ml-2 mr-2 sm:ml-12 sm:mr-12 lg:ml-24 lg:mr-24 svelte-bc69m9"),f(a,"class","h-full bg-gradient-to-t from-light to-grey dark:bg-black")},m(t,e){j(t,a,e),i(a,l),i(a,o),i(a,s),i(a,c),S(n,a,null),r=!0},p:v,i(t){r||(T(n.$$.fragment,t),r=!0)},o(t){B(n.$$.fragment,t),r=!1},d(t){t&&u(a),E(n)}}}class F extends y{constructor(a){super(),w(this,a,null,G,_,{})}}export{F as component};
